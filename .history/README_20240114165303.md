# keyboard-layout-editor-ortho-4x10-colemakdh-and-miryoku

Here are the http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com json<sup>*</sup> files various ortholinear 4x10, 4x12 and 5x12 [colemak-dh](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) colemak-dh layouts. I needed to figure these out for keyboard design stuff and I imagine they'll probably save someone out there a little time eventually. ⌨️

<sup>*</sup> I believe the json that http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com needs isn't 100% valid json. My VSCode was showing json errors, like it wanted everything wrapped in one more `[]`, but that wouldn't load in keyboard-layout-editor.com.
