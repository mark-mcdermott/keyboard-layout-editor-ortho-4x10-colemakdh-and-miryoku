# keyboard-layout-editor-ortho-4x10-colemakdh-and-miryoku

Here are the http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com json<sup>*</sup> files for a basic one-layer ortholinear 4x10 [colemak-dh](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) layout and then for a six-layer orthonlinear 4x10 [miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) colemak-dh layout. I needed to figure these out for keyboard design stuff and I imagine they'll probably save someone out there a little time eventually. ⌨️
